Algorithm chosen: Merge sort

Demo video: Please see video attached in the assignment

Problem Breakdown: 
  Decomposition: split the list in half until each list is equal to or less than 1 item long, then compare those two lists, and sort the first items in the list, then go to the next list until the entire list is sorted
  Pattern Recognition: the breaking down of the longer lists and the comparisions of the first object of two lists is commonly repeated
  Abstraction: the important information is the input list and the visual representation
